= VPI Pcap Library

The VPI Pcap library provides a set of Verilog VPI calls which can be
used to capture packets from a Verilog simulation and write them to
a pcap format file, which can then be read in to Wireshark or other
packet analysis tools.

This library is dependent on the "pcap" library used by tcpdump and
wireshark for their packet storage and description.  You can install
this by doing:

yum install libpcap-devel
